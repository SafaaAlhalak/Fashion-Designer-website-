# AI-Powered Web Development Project

This project showcases how modern AI tools can assist in building dynamic and interactive websites. By leveraging various AI technologies, the project streamlines the development process, automating key elements such as sitemap creation, content generation, code writing, design, and image creation.

## Tools Used

### 1. **Relume**  
   Relume is used to figure out the structure of the website by generating the pages and sections for the sitemap. It helps in laying out a clear structure that forms the backbone of the website.

### 2. **ChatGPT**  
   ChatGPT is employed to generate high-quality content for the website. From product descriptions to blog posts, ChatGPT helps in creating content based on the provided prompts, making content creation faster and more efficient.

### 3. **ChatGPT & GitHub Copilot**  
   Both ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot work together to write clean, optimized code based on project prompts and descriptions. These AI tools assist in writing both front-end and back-end code, accelerating the development process.

### 4. **AIColors.co**  
   AIColors.co is used to generate custom color schemes for the website theme. This tool ensures that the color palette is both visually appealing and consistent with the overall design goals of the website.

### 5. **DeepAI & Freepik**  
   DeepAI and Freepik are used to generate and source images for the project. Whether it's a unique image from AI generation or a stock image from Freepik, these tools help in adding the visual elements needed to complete the website's look.

### 6. EggGradients
EggGradients is utilized to create beautiful gradient color schemes for the website. This tool provides a range of gradient options that enhance the visual appeal of the design, from subtle to vibrant transitions.

### 7. **Spline**  
   Spline is used to create interactive 3D elements embedded into the website. This allows the website to display rich, interactive 3D objects that can be customized and manipulated by users.. These elements are added by embedding a simple script tag into the project. Example:
   
   ```html
   <script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@splinetool/viewer@1.9.62/build/spline-viewer.js"></script>
   <spline-viewer url="https://prod.spline.design/ELC9CUo3tx9ltXSo/scene.splinecode"></spline-viewer>
